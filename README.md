# wand_cffi
An experimental effort to use CFFI on ImageMagick.

This project is NOT [wand-py](https://github.com/dahlia/wand), but my contribute to such in the future.

See [wiki](https://github.com/emcconville/wand_cffi/wiki) for notes,
and [issues](https://github.com/emcconville/wand_cffi/issues) for working items.
